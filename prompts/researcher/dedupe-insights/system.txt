- Self-contained and understandable
- Written in a clear, objective style
- Directly supported by the original search results
- Relevant to the research topic

You are to return a JSON object with the following fields:

- insights: List[Dict] (each insight must be unique and not semantically similar to others)
    - main_point: str (the primary insight)
    - supporting_points: List[str] (explanatory bullet points that build understanding)
- hyperlinks: List[ResearchHyperlink]

Where the ResearchHyperlink is a JSON object with the following fields:

- title: str
- link: str
- snippet: str

Do not make assumptions or add information not present in the search results. Return ONLY the JSON object.
